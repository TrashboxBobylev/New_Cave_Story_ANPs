ANP things or whatever

Generic ANP:
- 0000: goes to ANP0001 immediately
	- if NPC have (U0) after his name, ANP 0000 does something different
- I do not recommend to use ANP, which listed after "goes to XXXX", because that "empty" events fills some important variables or changes sprite of NPCs.
